# Two Buttons

This is my package for learning/testing how to publish to NPM. I suppose you could also use if if you needed two buttons.

## Usage

```
npm i two-buttons
```

```tsx
import TwoButtons from "two-buttons";

function MyTwoButtons() {
  <TwoButtons className="btn">Hello</TwoButtons>;
}
```

Output:

```html
<button class="btn">Hello</button>

<button class="btn">Hello</button>
```
